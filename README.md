# ANN_bank_project

## Overview
In this project i have used a sample bank dataset which consist of 10,000 rows and 14 columns. The problem in the bank is customers are leaving the bank at higher rate and what i have did is i have used an ANN model that identifies the customers behaviers using the dataset and it will predict a customer wether he will stay in the bank or not.

## Dependencies
- tensorflow
- keras
- google colab
- bank dataset

## Layers
1) Input layer
2) Dense layer neurons (6), activation 'relu'
3) Dense layer neurons (6), activation 'relu'
4) Dense lalyer neurons (1), activation 'sigmoid'


## Usage
The accuracy of the prediction is 85%
